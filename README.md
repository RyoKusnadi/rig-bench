# rig-bench

A clean-slate multi-agent harness for Claude Code. Spec-driven development with a plan→execute pipeline, concurrent worktree-isolated execution, a structured lifecycle for every deliverable, and a persistent memory system that gives every agent codebase context without re-reading files.

## What It Is

**rig-bench** gives you a disciplined, end-to-end loop for AI-driven software engineering:

1. **Plan** — design a spec interactively before any code is written
2. **Execute** — implement specs concurrently, each agent in its own git worktree
3. **Verify** — confirm implementation matches requirements before marking as finished
4. **Remember** — structural index, git history, and AI-generated docs persist across runs so agents start informed

The `operator` agent is the core execution primitive. It runs inside an isolated git worktree per spec, creates a feature branch, implements, commits, and advances the spec through the lifecycle — all without touching any other spec's work.

## Design Principles

- **Spec first** — no code before the spec is written and approved
- **One spec = one PR** — sized to fit one feature branch and one review
- **Dependency ordering** — `depends_on` is the only coordination mechanism between specs
- **File-conflict gate** — before approval, every batch of specs is scanned for shared files; any two specs that touch the same file are chained via `depends_on` to prevent merge conflicts during concurrent worktree execution
- **Worktree isolation** — concurrent agents never share a working directory
- **Structured output** — every agent call returns a typed schema, not prose
- **State, not transcripts** — the workflow passes structured data between phases, never raw text
- **Memory over re-reading** — structural index, git history, and AI-generated docs are queried at task time; agents never cold-start without codebase context
